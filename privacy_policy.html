          <strong>Analytics and Advertising</strong><br>
          We may use analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand how users access and use the Services. In addition, we may work with agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and other technology services to place ads about our products and services on other websites and services. For example, we may place ads through Google, LinkedIn and other providers that you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services. 
          <br><br>
          As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into our own Services and related services (including our emails) as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services. Some of these tracking technologies may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you (“Interest-based Advertising”). 
          <br><br>
          As indicated above, vendors may act as our service providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. 
          <br><br>

Opting out only means that the selected participants should no longer deliver certain targeted ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., in connection with the participants’ other customers or from other technology services). You may also limit our use of information collected from or about your mobile device for purposes of serving targeted ads to you by going to your device settings and selecting “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (for Android devices). Please note that if you opt out using any of these methods, the opt out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out.
